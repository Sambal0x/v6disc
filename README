v6disc.sh

WHAT IT DOES:
A shell script designed for IPv6 automatic discovery of hosts, with the option to ping hosts.

IPv6 is different, with 18,446,744,073,709,551,616 (2^64) addresses on each subnet (or link) the old brute force method of scanning every address (e.g. with nnap) quickly becomes impossible in our lifetime.

KNOWING IPv6:
Understanding a little more about how IPv6 works, that each IPv6 node joins the multicast IPv6 all_notes group (FF02::1), one only needs to ping6 this group to determine which hosts are on the link. However, that only yields link-local addresses.

Also understanding how SLAAC addresses are formed from MAC addresses, the v6disc script can "guess" the globally routeable addresses of each host.

OPTIONAL PING6:
The script will also, optionally, ping6 the freshly "guessed" globally routeable addresses to validate the hosts exist.

OPTIONS:
The script support other options, including:
   -L   Display link-local hosts (useful when there is no global prefix on net)
   -i <intf>  Use intf rather than auto-detecting interfaces
   -D   Dual Stack, displays IPv6 and IPv4 addresses of discovered hosts
   -q   Quiet mode, only lists global discovered addresses, good for scripting 
   -h   Help

DEPENDENCIES:
Script requires bash, ip, grep, tr, sed, sort, cut, ping6 and ping (for Dual Stack). Most distros will have these already installed. Tested on OpenWRT (v15.05) after installing bash & ip.

LIMITATIONS:
The script assumes /64 subnets (as all end stations should be on a /64). Discovers only the SLAAC address (as defined by RFC 4862), and does not attempt to guess the temporary addresses. Only decects hosts on locally attached network (will not cross routers, but can run on OpenWRT router)

EXAMPLES:

Help

$ ./v6disc.sh -h
	./v6disc.sh - auto discover IPv6 hosts 
	e.g. ./v6disc.sh -D -P 
	-p  Ping discovered hosts
	-i  use this interface
	-L  show link-local only
	-D  Dual Stack, show IPv4 addresses
	-q  quiet, just print discovered hosts

Don't have a global routable prefix on your network. Still want to see how many IPv6 enabled hosts are ready for the IPv6 network? The link-local option, -L, will print only the discovered hosts (shown with Dual Stack option)

For those networks which are running Dual Stack, there is an option to print IPv4 addresses next to discovered IPv6 hosts.
