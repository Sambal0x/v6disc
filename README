v6-auto-discovery.sh

WHAT IT DOES:
A shell script designed for IPv6 automatic discovery of hosts, with the option to ping hosts.

IPv6 is different, with 18,446,744,073,709,551,616 (2^64) addresses on each subnet (or link) the old brute force method of scanning every address (e.g. with nnap) quickly becomes impossible in our lifetime.

KNOWING IPv6:
Understanding a little more about how IPv6 works, that each IPv6 node joins the multicast IPv6 all_notes group (FF02::1), one only needs to ping6 this group to determine which hosts are on the link. However, that only yields link-local addresses.

Also understanding how SLAAC addresses are formed from MAC addresses, the v6-auto-discovery script can "guess" the globally routeable addresses of each host.

OPTIONAL PING6:
The script will also, optionally, ping6 the freshly "guessed" globally routeable addresses to validate the hosts exist.

OPTIONS:
The script support other options, including:
   -L   Display link-local hosts (useful when there is no global prefix on net)
   -i <intf>  Use intf rather than auto-detecting interfaces
   -q   Quiet mode, only lists global discovered addresses, good for scripting 
   -h   Help

LIMITATIONS:
The script assumes /64 subnets (as all end stations should be on a /64). Discovers only the SLAAC address (as defined by RFC 4862), and does not attempt to guess the temporary addresses.
